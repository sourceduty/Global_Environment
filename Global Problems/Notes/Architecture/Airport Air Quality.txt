Airport air quality is a significant concern due to the high levels of pollution generated by aircraft operations, ground vehicles, and airport facilities. Aircraft emissions are a major contributor, releasing pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter (PM) into the atmosphere. These pollutants can degrade air quality in and around airports, posing health risks to passengers, airport workers, and nearby residents. The high volume of aircraft movements, especially at busy international airports, exacerbates these emissions, leading to elevated pollution levels.

Ground vehicles, including baggage carts, fuel trucks, and shuttle buses, also contribute to airport air quality issues. Many of these vehicles are powered by diesel engines, which emit substantial amounts of NOx and PM. Despite efforts to electrify ground support equipment and improve fuel efficiency, the transition is gradual, and diesel-powered vehicles remain prevalent. Additionally, the constant operation of these vehicles in confined spaces, such as airport terminals and tarmacs, can lead to localized air quality problems, further affecting the health and safety of airport personnel and travelers.

Airport facilities, including terminals, maintenance hangars, and fuel storage areas, also play a role in air quality degradation. These facilities often use large amounts of energy for heating, cooling, and lighting, contributing to emissions from power plants. Furthermore, maintenance activities, such as painting and fueling, release VOCs and other pollutants into the air. Airports are increasingly implementing green building practices and energy-efficient technologies to mitigate these emissions, but the overall impact on air quality remains a concern.

The health effects of poor air quality at airports are well-documented. Exposure to elevated levels of NOx, PM, and VOCs can cause respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and exacerbate existing health conditions like asthma. Airport workers, who spend extended periods in these environments, are particularly vulnerable. Studies have shown that airport employees, especially those working on the tarmac, have higher rates of respiratory issues compared to the general population. Passengers, although exposed for shorter durations, can also experience adverse effects, particularly if they have preexisting health conditions.

Addressing air quality at airports requires a multifaceted approach. This includes adopting cleaner technologies for aircraft and ground vehicles, improving operational practices to reduce emissions, and enhancing monitoring and mitigation strategies. Many airports are investing in electric ground support equipment, alternative fuels, and more efficient aircraft designs. Regulatory bodies are also setting stricter emission standards and encouraging the use of sustainable aviation fuels. Comprehensive air quality monitoring systems are essential to assess the effectiveness of these measures and ensure compliance with environmental standards, ultimately protecting the health of all airport users and nearby communities.
