> Alex: "Modernization and managing modernization has been a very difficult challenge for me to organize. I question when human traditions shouldn't be modernized like slavery and fossil fuel. I'm thinking about developing a custom GPT that decides when not to modernize human traditions which might foster a more efficient and modernized society. This custom GPT almost optimizes human modernization which is very difficult and conceptual. These conceptual decisions are what changes a society and culture."

This is important and difficult.
