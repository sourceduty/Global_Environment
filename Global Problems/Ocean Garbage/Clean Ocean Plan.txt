To address the staggering 8-12 million tons of plastic entering the oceans annually, a large-scale plan would require deploying a fleet of approximately 50 specialized ships, supported by a team of thousands of skilled employees, over a period of at least 10 years. Each ship would be equipped with advanced AI-driven robotic systems for identifying, collecting, and sorting plastic waste. Operating in high-pollution zones such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, river estuaries, and coastal areas, the fleet could aim to collect up to 1 million tons of waste annually. This scale would enable the removal of a significant portion of the annual plastic influx, while sensors and data-gathering technologies on the ships would provide real-time insights into waste composition and distribution patterns for global research and policy development.

The plan would involve approximately 10,000 personnel, including ship operators, AI and robotics engineers, marine scientists, and waste management professionals. Each ship would cost an estimated $50 million USD for construction and initial outfitting, with operational expenses of about $5 million USD annually, including crew salaries, maintenance, and fuel. Over a decade, the total cost per ship would be approximately $100 million USD, bringing the fleet's 10-year cost to $5 billion USD. Adding personnel costs, research expenses, and logistical support, the total program could cost around $8 billion USD, equivalent to approximately 10.9 billion CAD.

While expensive, this investment could result in the removal of 10-12 million tons of plastic over a decade, aligning with the annual influx rate. To maximize impact, the project would need to integrate with upstream interventions, such as improving global waste management systems, reducing plastic production, and promoting recycling. The initiative could attract funding through public-private partnerships, international environmental grants, and collaborations with corporations aiming to offset their environmental footprints. By combining cleanup operations with systemic changes, this plan offers a comprehensive approach to mitigating the ocean plastic crisis while providing actionable data to support sustainable solutions.
